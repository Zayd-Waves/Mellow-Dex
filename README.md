# Mellow Dex

A marshmallow pokedex.

### About
In anticipation for the upcoming Pokemon [Sun and Moon](http://www.serebii.net/sunmoon/) games, ol' Professor Zayd here decided it was time to make a fancy new Pokedex.

First off, a lot of credit goes to Awestruck Studios' [Dexter app.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.awestruckstudios.pkmn&hl=en) Their Android Pokedex was what inspired me to make my own. I really love Dexter and I use it all the time so please check it out on the Google Play Store!

The database used is based off of [Veekun's Pokedex Database](https://github.com/veekun/pokedex), another awesome dude who works really hard on maintaining an up-to-date and extensive source of data.

I currently don't have any plans to publish this on the app store because of the copyrighted Pokemon data, but I'll update this readme with instructions on how to build app into an .apk file you can download onto your phone.
