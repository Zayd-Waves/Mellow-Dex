A marshmallow pokedex.

### About
In anticipation for the upcoming Pokemon [Sun and Moon](http://www.serebii.net/sunmoon/) games, ol' Professor Zayd here decided it was time to make a fancy new Pokedex.

First off, a lot of credit goes to Awestruck Studios' [Dexter app.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.awestruckstudios.pkmn&hl=en) Their Android Pokedex was what inspired me to make my own. I really love Dexter and I use it all the time so please check it out on the Google Play Store!

The database used is based off of [Veekun's Pokedex Database](https://github.com/veekun/pokedex), another awesome dude who works really hard on maintaining an up-to-date and extensive source of data.
