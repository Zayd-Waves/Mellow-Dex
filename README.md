# Mellow Dex

A marshmallow pokedex.

## About
In anticipation for the upcoming Pokemon [Sun and Moon](http://www.serebii.net/sunmoon/) games, ol' Professor Zayd here decided it was time to make a fancy new Pokedex.

First off, a lot of credit goes to Awestruck Studios' [Dexter app.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.awestruckstudios.pkmn&hl=en) Their Android Pokedex was what inspired me to make my own. I really love Dexter and I use it all the time so please check it out on the Google Play Store!

The database used is based off of [Veekun's Pokedex Database](https://github.com/veekun/pokedex), another awesome person who works really hard on maintaining an up-to-date and extensive source of data.

I currently don't have any plans to publish this on the app store because of the copyrighted Pokemon data. If in the future I find a way to release a version that complies with Nintendo's trademarks, then sure! But until then you'll just have to load the apk manually.

## The Data
As tempting as it is to store all the data on a web server, my original goal was to provide a pokedex with all the data you'll need bundled up with it. There is a *ton* of information that needs to be stored though, so efficiency is key.

This software comes bundled with data from the Pok√©mon series of video games. This is all the intellectual property of Nintendo, Creatures, inc., and GAME FREAK, inc. and is protected by various copyrights and trademarks.
